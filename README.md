Super Prototypical download speed test app. Connects to a digitalocean droplet I set up and downloads a picture, returns estimated speed based on time and file size. 

If the app randomly stops working, likely I took down the digitalocean droplet, since I just used some free student credit to set it up (this was a school project for an iOS dev class). Also, speeds may not be accurate so don't use this to pester your ISP about bad speeds please! :)

Feel free to use any of the code or UI design patters to inspire your own ideas in projects, I have no intent to monetize or enfore copyright stuff (unless things are blatantly stolen I guess).
