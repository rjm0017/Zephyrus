Project for iOS Development (COMP 3970) at Auburn University

Super Prototypical download speed test app. Connects to a digitalocean droplet I set up and downloads a picture, returns estimated speed based on time and file size. 

I took down the digitalocean droplet, since I just used some free student credit to set it up, so connections would have to be changed to make it work. Also, speeds may not be accurate since this is very prototypical.

Feel free to use any of the code or UI design patters to inspire your own ideas in projects, I have no intent to monetize or enfore copyright stuff (unless things are blatantly stolen I guess).
